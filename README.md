Decentralized AI-Powered Fake News Detection
This project implements a full-stack solution for detecting fake news articles using both traditional and deep learning methods. A fine-tuned BERT model is deployed through a Flask backend API, while a React.js frontend allows users to input news text and view prediction results. The system is designed with modularity and real-time analysis in mind, providing a scalable foundation for future enhancements like federated learning and decentralized model updates.
